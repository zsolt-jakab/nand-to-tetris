# From Nand to Tetris
This project purpose is to provide programming solutions for the 
[From Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course.

In the root directory there are subdirectories containing the solutions and a README file for that solution.

For now my only goal with this project is to share my solutions, so I'm not looking for contributors.
Contribution could be an option in the future, but currently it is not.

About Nand2Tetris:
> In this project-centered course you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up.
> Weâ€™ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. 
> In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.
